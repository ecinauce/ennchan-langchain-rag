      ", EV batteries are charged and discharged through the flow of lithium ions between the anode (positively charged) and the cathode (negatively charged). The cathodes contain nickel, and play a role in delivering high energy density, which allows the vehicle to travel further. Cobalt in the cathodes ensures they don’t easily overheat or catch fire and helps to extend the life of batteries. An International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n",
      "report\n",
      "notes that a typical EV battery needs 8 kilograms (18 pounds) of lithium, 35 kilogram of manganese and 6-12 kilograms of cobalt.\n",
      "In the race to develop battery-power to meet net-zero commitments, however, it is important not to overlook the global implications of such a transition. New energy sources, such as those required for batteries and electric vehicles, are now exerting enormous pressures on the environment. Two questions are quickly arising: Are there sufficient resources and ability to meet these increasing demands? And, just as importantly, what are the societal costs of meeting these demands in this way?\n",

      "Efforts to meet the demand exerted by electric vehicles have so far been focused on increasing the supply of cobalt. In 2021, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was estimated to be producing between\n",
      "60 and 70%\n",
      "of the world’s supply of cobalt.\n",
      "The majority of the cobalt that is extracted is actually a by-product of existing copper mines. However, they are currently unable to increase their output to meet existing demands and have little financial incentive to do so until copper prices also rise to complement mining activity. The other major source of cobalt outside of existing copper mines in the DRC is produced via “artisanal” mining, producing up to\n",
      "15%\n",
      "of the global cobalt supply.\n",
      "Leading global sources of cobalt production\n",
      "Given that artisanal miners in the DRC are currently producing more than Russia – the world’s second largest producer – the role that they play and the conditions under which they operate are important to understand. Artisanal miners hand-dig higher-grade ores than those extracted through industrial or mechanised production means. But there are well-reported\n",
      "problems with artisanal mining\n",
      ", both in terms of the social and environmental cost.\n",
      "The small mines in which artisanal miners operate are often dangerous and polluting. The mining and refining processes are often labour intensive and associated with a\n",
      "variety of health problems\n",
      "as a result of accidents, overexertion, exposure to toxic chemicals and gases, and violence. And these miners, known locally as\n",
      "creseurs\n",
      ", are so economically reliant on this informal economy that these dangerous conditions cannot afford full consideration.\n",
      "The environmental costs of cobalt mining activities are also substantial. Southern regions of the DRC are not only home to cobalt and copper, but also large amounts of uranium. In mining regions, scientists have made note of high radioactivity levels. In addition, mineral mining, similar to other industrial mining efforts, often produces pollution that leaches into neighbouring rivers and water sources. Dust from pulverised rock is known to cause breathing problems for local communities as well.\n",

      "The Environmental Problems Caused by Mining\n",
      "International firms that trade, refine and supply cobalt have been trying to understand how cobalt from artisanal mining has entered their supply chains. While in theory there are legal differences to industrial and artisanal mining supplies, in reality, the boundary between the two remains quite blurry. Despite pledges from companies to increase transparency regarding their cobalt sources and refineries or pledges to buy exclusively from other countries, very little in the conditions on the ground in the DRC have changed.\n",
      "A dominant reason why there has been so little change in the region in a decade are the strong economic incentives resulting from artisanal mines. It is currently estimated that between\n",
      "140,000-200,000\n",
      "people work as artisanal miners in the DRC and most earn less than US$10 per day. While low compared to living standards in the Global North, that is considerably more than most earners in the country, who are living on an estimated US$1.90 a day.\n",
      "Considering the vast economic incentives, both domestically and internationally to keep artisanal cobalt mines open, what does the green energy transition look like next?\n",
      "Can We Improve Cobalt Mining?\n",
      "Given that cobalt-based batteries are a crucial and inevitable part of the green energy transition, both large-scale industrial mining and artisanal mining are here to stay. A World Economic Forum (WEF)\n",
      "white paper\n",
      "in 2020 outlined the current state of artisanal cobalt mining in the DRC and offered recommendations to make the industry fair and safer.\n",
      "Among them are the formalisation of a traditionally informal economy, which would include the adoption of common standards and metrics, the establishment of a monitoring and assessment process and knowledge-sharing, to ensure that a formalisation process is a multi-stakeholder one. Overall, the WEF suggests that increasing transparency would result in industry-wide changes. It also points to attempts formalisation of the garment industry almost 20 years ago as an example of common standards and metrics. However, critics would suggest that these efforts do little to address the root causes of systemic issues present in the artisanal mining industry and point to an\n",
      "increase in human rights violations in the garment industry\n",
      "as evidence of failure.\n",
      "What Does Reducing Cobalt Dependency Look Like?\n",
      "Rather than tackling supply-side problems with the cobalt mining industry, perhaps changes are better made on the demand side. Demand for cobalt is driven predominantly by the increased production of electric vehicles in an effort to decarbonise the transport sector. Some industry leaders have been attempting a pivot to cobalt-free batteries – technology which is already on the market.\n",
      "In 2020, Reuters reported that Chinese battery maker CATL was developing an EV battery that\n",
      "did not require the use of cobalt or nickel\n",

      "cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate\n",
      "– known also as lithium ferrophosphate or LFP batteries – proposed to be more sustainable alternatives.\n",
      "But perhaps each of these alternatives are simply examples of environmental problem-shifting. In each of these scenarios, transitioning to EVs and developing cobalt-free batteries often lead to new, and sometimes more chaotic, complicated and severe environmental problems – something that we refer to as ‘environmental problem-shifting’. Critics have suggested that instead, a more radical and long-term solution would involve investments that\n",

A switch away from individual vehicles to electric mass transit, complemented by the development of separate bike lanes and broad pavements, would perhaps start to address this persistent issue of environmental problem-shifting.

      "In a time of multiple emergencies – climate chaos, the pandemic, rising economic insecurity –  fast decision-making is a necessity. Technology is often cited as playing a critical role in catalysing the renewable energy transition, but it is important to remember that technologies exist to serve us, not to dominate us. Perhaps a more radical approach to decarbonising the energy sector does not involve problem-shifting to the DRC, but instead in drastically reducing our dependence on the concept of cars themselves.\n",
